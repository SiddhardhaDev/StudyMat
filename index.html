                    A chemical equation containing simply symbols of elements and molecular formulae of the substance without balancing is known as Primary (or) skeleton equation.

                    The symbols of elements and formulae of the compounds should not be changed but only their coefficient should be altered while balancing the chemical equation.

                    Acid - base indicators are dye (or) mixtures of dyes which are used to detect the presence of acids & bases.

                    Acidic nature of a substance is due to the formation of H<sup>+</sup> ions in solution. Formation of OH<sup>-</sup> (aq) ions in solution is responsible for the basic nature of a substance.

                    The substances whose odour changes in acidic (or) basic medium are called olfactory indicators.

                    Onion, vanilla essence and clove oils are examples for olfactory indicators.
